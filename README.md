# Retro-R36S-Atmega328P-MOD  
This project contain's mod to RetroConsole R36S, to enable internal functions like WIFI / BLUETOOTH using console buttons.  

That was the idea. I still need to make hardware modifications. Just waiting for the components.  
Need to check if console uart works and it's available form os as COM. If it is, then check if i can send uart messages from the system. If can, then we can add options to change shortcuts form the OS.  
IF this two options will not be available we can try do this by audio ouput and reading from the analog.
